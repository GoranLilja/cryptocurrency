This is an experiment where I'm trying to learn how block chain works.

## How to running the code
1. Make sure you've got `node` and `typescript` installed globally.
2. Checkout this code.
3. Open up the Terminal and navigate to the folder.
4. Run `npm install`.
5. Run `npm start` to compile the code and run it.
